        <p>French fries topped with my favorite street taco and smothered in queso. Loaded fries don't get much better than this. Don't forget your favorite hot sauce.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef skirt steak, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lager beer (such as Corona®)</li>
            <li>½ (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning with coriander and annatto (such as Goya®)</li>
            <li>1 (26 ounce) package frozen French fries</li>
            <li>1 cup queso blanco sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak, beer, and sazon seasoning in a gallon-sized resealable bag. Refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread French fries evenly on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook steak for 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake fries in the preheated oven until light golden in color, 11 to 15 minutes. Divide among 4 serving plates and drizzle queso over the top.</li>
            <li>Slice steak across the grain into bite-sized pieces and scatter over the fries. Garnish with onion and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
